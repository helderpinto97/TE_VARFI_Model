# TE_VARFI_Model

Estimation of the Transfer Entropy incorporating long memory using VARFI modelling.

Analytical framework for the multiscale analysis of multivariate Gaussian processes, whereby the computation of Partial Information Decomposition measures is
achieved accounting for the simultaneous presence of short-termdynamics and long-range correlations using Vector Autoregressive Fractionally Integrated
(VARFI) Model.
